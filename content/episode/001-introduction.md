Description: Here is the inaugural episode of the R-Podcast! In this episode, I take
  a few minutes to introduce myself and to explain the main goals of this podcast.
  I also define what R is and give an overview of R's history of development and features
  that distinguish it from other statistical software. Please feel free to send your
  feedback to theRcast[at]gmail.com or leave a voice mail at 1-269-849-9780.
