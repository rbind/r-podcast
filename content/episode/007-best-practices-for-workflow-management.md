Description: 'Hello everybody, I am finally back with a new episode! In this episode:
  Hardware issues, major update to RStudio, new forums, and discussion on managing
  your workflow for projects. I discuss useful functions for executing R scripts and
  saving/loading R objects for future sessions, and summarize different solutions
  for organizing R code based on task and via the ProjectTemplate package, along with
  the importance of version control. Please check out the new forums and let me know
  what you think! If you are interested in providing a listener tip about R, please
  call the voicemail hotline at +1-269-849-9780 or record a short mp3 or ogg audio
  clip and send it to theRcast(at)gmail.com . As always I welcome any other feedback
  you have. Thanks for listening! P.S. From our [Google Plus page](https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/111193531932434833188/),
  Darren pointed out that I switched forward slashes with backward slashes in my discussion
  about file paths in Episode 6. Thanks Darren!'
