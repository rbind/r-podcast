Description: In this episode of the R-Podcast I have a conversation with my colleague
  [Will Landau](http://will-landau.com/) about his new R package [drake](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/drake/)
  that provides a powerful build system for analysis pipelines.  In addition we have
  a fun R community roundup, listener feedback, and a couple of package picks to give
  you a [gentle nod](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/remindR/vignettes/remindR_vignette.html)
  and a fun way to [explore interpolation](https://github.com/metrumresearchgroup/fluidSpline).  If
  you have ideas for topics, questions, or other types of feedback, get in touch with
  me by heading over to the R-Podcast site at [r-podcast.org](https://www.r-podcast.org),
  sending a note to `thercast[at]gmail.com`, or contacting me at [@thercast](https://twitter.com/thercast)
  on Twitter.  As always thanks for tuning in and I hope you enjoy episode 22 of the
  R-Podcast!
