Description: Direct from the first-ever [Shiny Developer conference](http://blog.rstudio.org/2015/10/29/shiny-developer-conference-stanford-university-january-2016/),
  here is episode 16 of the [R-Podcast](www.r-podcast.org)!  In this episode I sit
  down with [Dean Attali](http://deanattali.com/) for an engaging conversation about
  his journey to using R, his motivation for creating the innovative [shinyjs](https://github.com/daattali/shinyjs)
  package, and his perspective on teaching others about R through his support of the
  innovative and highly-praised [Stats 545](http://stat545-ubc.github.io/) course
  at UBC. In addition you'll hear about how his previous work prepared him well for
  using R, his collaboration with the RStudio team, and much more.  I hope you enjoy
  this episode and thanks for listening!
