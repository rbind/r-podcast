Description: The R-Podcast concludes its series on the Shiny Developer Conference
  with a jam-packed episode featuring two interviews with members of the [RStudio
  team](https://www.rstudio.com/about/)!  In part one I have a panel discussion with
  JJ Allaire, Jeff Allen, and Hadley Wickham to get their impressions of the conference
  and some exciting new features in the latest version of the RStudio IDE.  In part
  two I have an extended conversation with Joe Cheng to discuss the origins of Shiny,
  how the conference came together, and ideas for future enhancements of shiny. All
  of this and more on episode 18 of the R-Podcast!
