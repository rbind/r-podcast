Description: "The R-Podcast has risen again! After sharing the story of my R adventures since the last episode, we focus on a very important initiative that could pave the way for the next generation of developers contributing to the future of R itself. I am joined by research software engineer Heather Turner and statistician Saranjeet Kaur Bhogal to share the story of how the new R Development Guide brings a new and accessible approach for learning how to contribute to the R project itself, along with their vision of the upcoming Collaborative Campfires to inspire and grow the community around this imporant effort."
