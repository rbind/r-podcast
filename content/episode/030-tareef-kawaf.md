Description: "It's common knowledge that R has been at the forefront of leading innovation in statistics and data science. But one area that's not commonly discussed is how to build a successful business around R and open-source?  In episode 30 of the R-Podcast, I am very excited to be joined by RStudio president Tareef Kawaf!  We cover a wide variety of topics including his journey to RStudio, building a robust organization structure, and how an open-core model drives RStudio's vision for the present and future.  Plus you'll hear how Tareef became the 'T-Test' within RStudio and how he earned the moniker of Mr. Shiny!"
