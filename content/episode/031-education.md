Description: "The R-Podcast returns with a recap of the Joint Statistical Meetings (JSM) 2019 conference!  In this episode, I share insights gained from an excellent panel discussion on the use of javascript in statistics, and I am joined by RStudio's education team members Alison Hill & Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel to discuss new ideas for teaching data science effectively, as well as how tools like R-Markdown are opening many new possibilities for both students and teachers.  I hope you enjoy episode 31 of the R-Podcast!"
