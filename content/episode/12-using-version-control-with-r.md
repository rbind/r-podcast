Description: This is not an April Fool's joke ... The R-Podcast is back once again!
  In this episode, I discuss the concept of version control and how you can get started
  with using the Git VCS right now with your R projects. Also I discuss a big batch
  of listener feedback, and highlight a couple of great visualization applications
  from the community using ggplot2. All of that and more on episode 12 of the R-Podcast!

#### The basics for version control and Git

-   Why it's important: Backups and reproducibility
-   Git is available for all major platforms, see GitHub page for installation instructions for all operating systems
-   IDEs RStudio and Eclipse via Egit plugin offer integration of Git for easy usage
-   Key commands: `git init`, `git add file.R`, `git commit -m "my commit message"`
-   Tell Git what files you don't want to be tracked with `.gitignore` file(s)
-   [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/) are two excellent remote repository host sites
-   [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control) article on revision control
