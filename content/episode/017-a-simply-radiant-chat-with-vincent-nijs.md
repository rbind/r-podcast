Description: The R-Podcast continues its series on Shiny and the first-ever Shiny
  Developer Conference by catching up with [Vincent Nijs](http://rady.ucsd.edu/faculty/directory/nijs/),
  associate professor of marketing at UC San Diego and one of the earliest adopters
  of Shiny.  Some of the topics we cover include his journey to using R, his motivation
  and process for developing the [Radiant](http://vnijs.github.io/radiant/) Shiny
  application used by his students to perform business analytics, and how he would
  like to involve the community to add new capabilities to Radiant.  I hope you enjoy
  this episode and thanks for listening!
