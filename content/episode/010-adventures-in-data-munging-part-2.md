Description: I'm happy to present episode 10 of the R-Podcast! Season 1 of the R-Podcast
  concludes with part 2 of my series on data munging, in which I discuss issues surrounding
  importing data sets contained in HTML tables. I share how I used the XML and RCurl
  packages to validate and import data from [hockey-reference.com](http://www.hockey-reference.com)
  for storage into a MySQL database. Our listener feedback segment contains another
  installment on the Pitfalls of R contributed by listener Frans. I want to thank
  everyone who has provided such positive feedback throughout the season, and I'm
  looking forward to providing some exciting new content for season 2. I hope you
  enjoy the episode and check out our new contact page if you would like to provide
  any feedback. Thanks for listening!
