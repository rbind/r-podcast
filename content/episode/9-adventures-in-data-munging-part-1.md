Description: It’s great to be back with a new episode after an eventful break! This
  episode begins a series on my adventures in data munging, a.k.a data processing.
  I discuss three issues that demonstrate the flexibility and versatility R brings
  for recoding messy values, important inconsistent data files, and pinpointing problematic
  observations and variables. We also have an extended listener feedback segment with
  an audio installment of the “pitfalls” of R contributed by listener Frans. I hope
  you enjoy this episode and keep passing along your feedback to theRcast(at)gmail.com
  and stop by the forums as well!
