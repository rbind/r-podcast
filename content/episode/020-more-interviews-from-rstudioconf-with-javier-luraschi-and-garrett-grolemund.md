Description: In episode 20 I'm happy to bring you more great interviews with members
  of [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com) from [rstudio::conf](https://www.rstudio.com/conference/)!  I
  had the pleasure of chatting with software engineer [Javier Luraschi](https://github.com/rstudio/)
  to discuss [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) and the new [sparklyr](http://spark.rstudio.com/index.html)
  package that allows R users to connect directly to a Spark cluster for high-performance
  data analyses.  In addition you will hear from RStudio's master instructor [Garret
  Grolemund](http://twitter.com/RStudio) to get his recommendations for teaching R
  and the highly-acclaimed [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) book.  All
  of this plus a package pick that could enable me to use R in my podcast workflow
  in episode 20 of the R-Podcast!
