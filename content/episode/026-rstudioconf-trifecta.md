Description: "Another spectacular rstudio::conf is in the books and the R-Podcast has tons of insights to share!  We kick off our coverage with a three-podcast crossover as I am joined by Credibly Curious co-host Nick Tierny and Not So Standard Deviations co-host Hilary Parker!  We discuss our impressions of the conference and where we'd like to see R go in 2019.  Plus I share how my journey to the Advanced R-Markdown workshop is a testament to the welcoming and openness that the R community offers. This is just the beginning of our coverage and I hope you enjoy this episode!"
