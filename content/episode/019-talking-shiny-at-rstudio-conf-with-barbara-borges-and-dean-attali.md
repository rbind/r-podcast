Description: 'The [R-Podcast](http://www.r-podcast.org/) has landed in Orlando for
  the first ever [rstudio::conf](https://www.rstudio.com/conference/)!  Our coverage
  begins with two excellent interviews: First I talk with [BÃ¡rbara Borges Ribeiro](https://github.com/bborgesr),
  software engineer at [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) about her journey to using
  R and her advice for developing [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) apps.  Then [Dean
  Attali](http://deanattali.com/) makes his return to the show and we discuss R''s
  role in his graduate research and his experiences as a Shiny consultant.  All of
  this plus a package pick that can give Shiny app users a helping hand.  I hope you
  enjoy episode 19 of the R-Podcast!'
