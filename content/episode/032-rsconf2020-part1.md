Description: "rstudio::conf 2020 has officially come to a close, and the R-Podcast brings you the first of multiple episodes covering this huge event!  In this episode, I share my perspective on the big news made by RStudio and my take on where this could lead open-source data science.  In addition, I am joined by RStudio software engineer Kevin Ushey to discuss his path to joining RStudio, the feature of the RStudio IDE he is most proud of, and the adventures of developing packrat and renv to manage package dependencies. Lastly, I share a new audio series that led to my first mobile Shiny app. Thank you for listening and I hope you enjoy this episode!"
